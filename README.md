# Fantom Ghost Transaction Hunter 👻

Fantom is the fastest chain for a reason — sometimes transactions literally cost **0 gas**.


This script catches those magical "ghost moves":  
big FTM transfers (10+ FTM) that appear out of thin air with **zero gas price**.


What you're seeing:
- SpookySwap internal accounting tricks
- Pre-signed meta-transactions
- Devs moving funds like wizards
- Pure Fantom sorcery

```bash
python fantom_opera_ghost_tx.py
